## Features

**When Swiss Knife is active Dark theme is enabled by default.**

The rest of the features are disabled by default and need to be enabled. This decision is made in case you already use competitors' similar features, and it's easier not to have conflicts by default.

Each feature can enable/disable separately or in bulk with pressing first check box.

After you set up configuration press save to apply changes.

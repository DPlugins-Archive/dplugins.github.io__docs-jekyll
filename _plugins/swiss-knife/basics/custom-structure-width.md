By default, the structure panel is only 300px in width. That will not allow you are nesting more than five elements, and after that, you will get vertical scrollbars that can be avoided by choosing the size you like.

Now you can set up whatever size you need.

Go you Swiss Knife &gt; Features and under **Structure Width** type width you prefer.

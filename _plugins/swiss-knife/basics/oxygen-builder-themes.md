With Swiss Knife themes you will get optimized elements that bring necessary actions into the focus. Get a richer experience with a more emphasized UI. There are several themes you can choose from: Dark, Light, and Default (Oxygen Builder Colors).

## Dark theme

Brings a richer and more vivid look. It's perfect for saving eyes during the night and brings much more contrast than the default theme. It's not just the colors that are changed here. Input fields and buttons have emphasized hovers states and icons have more contrast. With all combined, you will get a modern look and faster flow when you won't struggle to spot things faster.

## Light theme

Lighten themes are known for better contrast than dark themes. Especially if you work during the day close to the window or outside. By purchasing the Swiss Knife you will unlock this theme that was missing from Oxygen Builder.

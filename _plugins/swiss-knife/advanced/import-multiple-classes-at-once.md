Finally, you can use your favorite frameworks with classes autocomplete. If frameworks are bloated for you, set up your Agency naming convention and use it in every project.

Imported classes need to have a folder where they will be stored. Before you import them, go to selectors and create a folder.

All imported classes can be found under selectors &gt; used folder ( then classes were imported ). Then can be managed as any other class made from oxygen builder.

## New Feature: Lock when importing

When importing classes now it's available to lock that at the same time. Activate checkbox and all clases will be lock during import.

Note: This will not effect previously imported classes. They are locked in import process.

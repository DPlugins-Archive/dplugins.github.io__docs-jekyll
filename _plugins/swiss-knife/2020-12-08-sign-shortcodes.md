Remove unnecessary steps. **Now is just under one click.**

Every time you are transferring your website, you will often need to assign Shortcodes, and the option is hidden pretty deep.

You will need to go to:

1. Oxygen
2. Settings
3. Security Tab
4. Sign All Shortcodes link

With Swiss Knife, they are under the admin subpage, and you can get it with just one click.

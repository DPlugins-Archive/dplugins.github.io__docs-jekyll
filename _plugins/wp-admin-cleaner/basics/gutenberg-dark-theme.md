title: 'Gutenberg Dark Theme'
---

Enjoy in lightweight Gutenberg dark theme that is **only 2kb**. Save your eyes and focus on the content.

This theme is separated from WP Admin and Post Classic view. Some users disable Gutenberg and we didn't want to include it with the rest if Gutenberg is disabled.

Theme does not interact with the content.

Oxygen will disable your theme and you will end up with dark panel but you will still have big white background. If you are using Oxygen enable 3rd switch instead 2nd:

- Gutenberg optimized for Oxygen

**Note: If you are using 3rd disable 2nd option.**

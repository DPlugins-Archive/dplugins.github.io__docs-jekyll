title: 'WordPress Admin Dark Theme'

## Activate Themes

For night owls and developers that are using dark themes in other applications, we are bringing dark theme in WordPress admin. The idea is to save their eyes from constantly switching between dark and light theme (WordPress default).

The entire theme is **only 3kb** and will have no impact on admin performance. Theme is loaded only inside WP admin and will not impact website front end.

It is disabled by default and you can enable it under the new 3rd tab (Themes).   
**Toggle WP Admin switch.**

title: System Fonts

When Oxy Font Manager is activated it loads system fonts - fonts stack.

You will be able to use System Fonts 100 to 900 weight.

Just choose 'system-ui' font family from the font menu

**Note: In the next plugin version we will create Font Stack for System Serif and System Monotype as well.**

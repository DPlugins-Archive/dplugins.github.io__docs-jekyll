title: 'GDRP Friendly fonts in Oxygen Builder'
---

****Oxygen is not self-hosting fonts. Builder only provides links to Google's CDN.****

Not self-hosting and using Google Fonts CDN will lead to users' ID addresses being personal information leaked. If you are doing that you can pay a big fine. Otherwise, you need to bloat websites with GDPR complainant banners that will ruin design and users' experience.

Oxygen and many other builders by default use Google Fonts CDN.

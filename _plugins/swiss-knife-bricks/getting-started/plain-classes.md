## Plain Classes vs Bricks Classes

Writhing classes and editing them is much easier if class is plain text and not presented as not editable tag. 

Example if you need to change background from bg-blue-100 to bg-blue-300. In Bricks class system you need to delete entire class and add new one. In Plain Classes you only need to change number 1 to 3. 

## Autocomplete

In version 1.0 we added Tailwind autocomplete that is fatched from Windends JSON file. 

1. Go to Winden > General > Enable Autocomplete
2. Save Changes
3. Re-generate autocomplete
4. Wait for status change from the Pending to `**Success**`.

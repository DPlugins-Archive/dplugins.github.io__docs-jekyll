title: Copy Paste Classes
---

If you are using utility classes or you have already added content, styling should be easy. At the moment, you need to 
1. Open element
2. Read and remember classes 
3. and then type it into another element. 

The biggest problem is that you must repeatedly repeat steps 1, 2, and 3.

### Focus should be on visuals. 

1. See the element that you need to reuse styles. 
2. You copy all styles (classes) that element has, and you 
3. Paste it to another element or multiple elements. 

Coping the classes is also beneficial: the action can be repeated until you don't copy another style or clear the clipboard data.

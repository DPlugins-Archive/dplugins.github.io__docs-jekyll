## Enable files upload

For self-hosting scripts, we use WordPress media uploaded and save scripts inside the media upload folder. WordPress does not allow .js and .css file types to be uploaded by default. That is why you must check "Allow CSS/JS Uploads." If you use scripts from CDN, you will not need this option enabled. 

## Add new script

Navigate to the Swiss Knife `Bricks > Scripts Manager` and press "+ Add New Script"

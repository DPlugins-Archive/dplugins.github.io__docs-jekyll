Since working in Oxygen is much faster in the local environment we made it possible that users to download copies of the website. Work on the edit and export only things you have edited ( Session ).

Once you finished edits you can export them.

Each session separately by pressing the export button in the Session card.

Upload it to the live website by pressing the import button and locating .JSON file to your local machine.

Once copy or copies are imported select one you want to edit and continue with your work.

**Imported sessions are not applied to your live website. You need to publish it first.**

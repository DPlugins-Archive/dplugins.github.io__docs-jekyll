## daisyUI
![](../../img/des-kits/daisyUI.png)

This is quite an interesting addition to this list. You'll first notice that daisyUI uses a custom - simpler - syntax for its components. In fact, whereas you'd need to write several utilities to style a button with raw Tailwind - daisyUI does it with a single "btn" tag.

## Tailwind is on the rise

What are the next four years for Tailwind going to look like? We know that v3.0 was released recently. This release brought in improvements for performance, and browser integration, among other new features. Is this only the beginning?

If there is one thing we can learn from this framework is that developers aren't opposed to learning new systems. Sure, the syntax might take a while to truly master. But, the speed at which you can build a fully functional layout is unprecedented.

And given Tailwind's popularity, it's super quick to find useful resources in the context of component libraries and individual design elements. As of October 2022, Tailwind CSS gets over 4.2 million weekly downloads on npm. And that's just for the base library alone.

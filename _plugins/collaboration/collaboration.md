Finally, multitasking and collaboration are possible inside Oxygen Builder.  
Sync changes inside Oxygen Builder between all open tabs or browsers.

This tool is perfect for agencies where they have multiple people working on the same website or even the same page.

If you are a solo freelancer, this tool will still be beneficial for you as you can now work in multiple tabs at the same time and all the changes will be reflected without even refreshing the page. And we know how much time you will save if you don't need to load builder over and over again.

If you have installed, configured, and activated the Collaboration plugin correctly,  
once you have opened Oxygen builder you will notice the badge "Collaboration with Green Dot" in the bottom right corner.

When you reload oxygen builder you will notice a yellow dot is flashing and then it turns out green that means that the Collaboration plug-in is ready.

  
*While the dot is yellow none of the edits will be fetched with the Collaboration plug-in.*

As confirmation, you can click on the calibration beds and open the bank details. In the first row, you can see ready in idle.

## Daily

The easiest way to explain this is that the daily setting will be run every day without any interruptions or any limit.

This option will unlock the section below to choose days in a week, from Monday to Sunday. Written code will be active on that day or days. Multiple selections are also allowed. Selected day(s) will run in a loop and activate code every week, not just the incoming week.

This option will unlock the section below with the calendar to choose a specific date when you want to run the code. The date is one-time-only code execution and will run only on that day, month, year.

This option will unlock the section below with the two calendars to choose specific dates from when you want to run the code. The date range is one-time-only code execution in the date range you have chosen.

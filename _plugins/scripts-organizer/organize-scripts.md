## Scripts List

Since Scripts Organizer is WordPress native-oriented you can manage scripts the same as any other post or a page. In the Scripts list, you can sort them by title or date.

If you open Script you can also apply WordPress native tags and group them together. Tags are also visible in Scripts List and you can narrow the list by selecting the tag.

Besides tags, we also offer a description box where you can write what each script does. Sometimes the title won't be enough to remind you of the purpose of your script, in the long run, this feature can save you your precious time.

title: 'Template AKA Conditions'

These settings will narrow down where our code will be executed.

## All

By default, option "All" is selected and this means that all the pages will be affected by written code.

## Page, Post

This option will unlock the section below to choose which single Page, Post, or even Custom post type you want to select to apply written code to it. Multiple selections are also allowed. There is no limit to how many single posts or pages you will apply the code to.

## Post Type

This option will unlock the section below to choose with the post types group you want to apply the code to. For example, you can apply code to all Pages or Posts at once. If you have registered custom post types in this example "Portfolio" you can apply code to all Portfolio posts at once. Multiple selections are also allowed (posts, portfolios).

## Taxonomy

This option is a little different from the one above. This option will unlock the section below to choose with the taxonomies archive and not the group you want to apply the code to. Taxonomies are Categories, Tags, or custom registered ones (Portfolio Categories). Multiple selections are also allowed.

To explain it better if you select Categories code will be applied to the "Archive: Categories" page and not to posts that have categories.

Looking at the code all day long is hard, so we are making constant improvements. From Dark to Light mode, transition between night and day for better contrast, to even custom code editor font size.

Same as WordPress Native we are using a light theme by default.

Changing the theme is transferred from Features to the inside of Code Editor.

Once you enter Edit mode Change theme toggle will be located on the bottom left side. Find circle icon.

The changed theme will stay across entire Code Editors and no additional savings is required.

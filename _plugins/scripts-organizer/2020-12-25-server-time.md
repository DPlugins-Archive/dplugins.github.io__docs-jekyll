If you are preparing scripts to be triggered at an exact time it is important that your plan is synchronized with your server time. This is especially important when you are testing the scripts if you are in a different time zone than your server.

We got you covered there by including the server time and server date widget on the top of the settings.

Every time you refresh the browser the time will be updated. It is not updated in live time as we are saving server resources.

To give a little more space to the settings features.

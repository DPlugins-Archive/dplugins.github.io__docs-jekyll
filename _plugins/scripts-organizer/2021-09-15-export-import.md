## Scripts Organizer Bulk Export

We support WordPress native bulk actions. Activate the checkbox on the top to select all, or select several by clicking one by one.

After making the selection click on **Bulk actions &gt; Export Selected and then hit Apply button**.

You will get a .JSON file to store it on your computer.

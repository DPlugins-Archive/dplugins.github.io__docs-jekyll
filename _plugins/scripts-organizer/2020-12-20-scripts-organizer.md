## The most advanced code editor for WordPress

### for PHP, Scripts, and Styles with code autocomplete to makes your coding writing faster.

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full">![](https://docs.dplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Scripts-Organizer.jpg)</figure>Our unique feature is that you can write HTML, Script, Styles, PHP, and create a shortcode at the same time. Everything is split into several code blocks that can be switched between a row and a column view, depending on whether you are working on a smaller or bigger screen and you don't want to scroll up and down.

## Visual studio Experience

We are using Monaco Code Editor that is powering Visual Studio Editor. You will have a desktop app experience without the hassle to set up SCSS or copying, pasting, or syncing files between localhost and server.

## SCSS Partials

Now you can use the full power of SCSS inside your workflow. You can create reusable partials and call them in code blocks. If you have separate CSS for every post type you don't need to repeat yourself and reuse typography, colors, breakpoints, and others.

## Selective page or post execution

If you donâ€™t want your code published across the entire website, you can narrow the executions with conditions. You can target post or taxonomy archive, post type, or even a specific post or page.

## Date scheduling 

Besides targeting script types you can include or compliment them with the date of execution. Target your post type on Monday and Wednesday and target the home page from Jun 21st to Jun 23rd easily with our date range condition.

## Time scheduling

If the date range is not precise enough you can execute one script on Monday until Friday, 09:00 - 17:00, and another one when the shop closes. Date and time settings follow your **[Server Clock and Calendar](https://docs.dplugins.com/docs/scripts-organizer/server-time/)** to ensure that you are scheduling scripts at the right time.

## WordPress native

We are using WordPress' native environment and every script is published like every other blog post. That way you will be familiar with the plugin usage and a minimal learning curve will be applied.

## Organize code blocks with tags

For script organization you can use WordPress tags, this will help you find and sort scripts easier. In the Admin panel, you can also sort them by Title or Date once they are published. Besides tags, you can write detailed comments on what each script does, so you don't need to open it and look at the code.

## Quick toggle to activate code

For testing, you can use Enable/Disable toggle to see if the script is doing something wrong to your website or just to test how it looks before and after the script is active.

## Safe mode if code is wrong. No more white screen of death

One wrong character in PHP can cause a white screen of death. With Safe mode, you don't need to be scared anymore. Scripts Organizer is checking the code and every time there is an error Safe mode is triggered. You can disable the script or improve the code and then update it.

## Smart way to include scripts

[Scripts Manager](https://docs.dplugins.com/docs/scripts-organizer/scripts-manager/) is such a powerful feature that it is even cross-functional with Swiss Knife. You can upload your favorite Frameworks like bootstrap or GreenSock. Once it's included you can choose if the file is enqueued (available across the entire website) or register it to be triggered when you need it.

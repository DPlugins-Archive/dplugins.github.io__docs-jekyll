## Preview Pressets

By default, full width and height are selected. You can use the dropdown to choose one of the predefined sizes to preview better your development for mobiles, tablets, and desktops.

Preview sizes are synced with Figma Artboard sizes to be able to have pixel-perfect design and development.

If your screen is not big enough but you still need to preview development in certain sizes or proportions we make it possible for you with scale factors.

Possible options are 100%, 75% and 50%.

## Preview Changes

are visible after every code update. Use shortcut Control (âŒ˜) + S to save and see changes right away.

After you save page is reloaded and if you are doing animations such as GSAP animation will be triggered as well.

Code Navigator is available for **Code Blocks** and **SCSS Partials**, and it is located under the gear tab (Page settings)

To save space and reduce clutter's **excluding from the list:**

- Current Code Block / SCSS Partial
- Code Block / SCSS Partial that are set as Drafts and not Published.

The reason behind hiding drafts - you most likely don't need them if you set them like that.

## Hide Code Navigator

Code Navigator is enabled by default and you can disable it by opening Screen Options:

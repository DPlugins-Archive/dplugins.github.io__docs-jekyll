## All Day

By default, option "All Day" is selected and our script will run for the whole day from 00:00 to 24:00.

This option will unlock the section below to choose when you want a script to run "START AT SPECIFIC TIME" and when to end the script "END AT SPECIFIC TIME". The timer popup has options to choose hours from 00 to 24 and minutes 00, 15, 30, and 45.

If you are using "Time" option you **MUST** enter script **start** and **end time**.

The entire line can be used for resizing. We made an icon to indicate that that element is able to resize.

## Preview Pressets

By default, full width and height are selected. You can use the dropdown to choose one of the predefined sizes to preview better your development for mobiles, tablets, and desktops.

Preview sizes are synced with Figma Artboard sizes to be able to have pixel-perfect design and development.

Possible options are 100%, 75% and 50%.
